 <h3>Pet Friendly</h3>

                <p>
                    We are a pet friendly motel, and there are plenty of places to walk your pooch right out the door.
                    We are across from an excellent multi-use path that goes from Okanagan College to Okanagan Landing.
                    There is also a dog park and a walking path right across the street. We are just blocks from Polson
                    Park, Vernon's oldest and largest public park. Polson park offers a skate park, tennis courts, a
                    playground, ducks and swans, lawn bowling, and outdoor exercise equipment. You can also check out
